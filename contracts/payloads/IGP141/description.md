# Close Down the dexV1 Test DEX, Rebalance Vault 3, Launch the weETH/ETH Vault, Remove Team Multisig wstETH/cbBTC Borrow Limits, Exit iETHv2 Test Positions, Close Down IGP-45 Test DEXes id1/id2/id3, Restrict and Pause Pre-Launch Vaults, Vaults 35-40, USDe Vaults 66-73 and Dust-Launch Vaults, Close dex 5, Cap dex 27

> **DRAFT.** Actions are added as they are agreed in #gov-proposals-lineup.

## Summary

This proposal fully restricts the Liquidity Layer limits of the early **dexV1 test DEX** (wstETH/ETH, `0x6d83...e03a`) so it can no longer withdraw or borrow, rebalances the **wstETH/ETH T1 vault (3)** borrow side that is stuck behind its dust borrow limit, raises the **weETH/ETH T1 vault (182)** from the IGP-140 dust limits to launch limits, reduces the **Team Multisig** wstETH and cbBTC borrow limits on the Liquidity Layer to dust, withdraws **iETHv2**'s residual test positions before they are frozen, fully restricts the Liquidity Layer limits of the IGP-45 test DEXes **id1** (wstETH/ETH) and **id3** (WBTC/cbBTC), restricts and pauses at the Liquidity Layer the five **pre-launch vaults** of the old VaultFactory, the two old DEXes, and the debt of vaults **42 / 43**, and restricts and pauses the last IGP-45 test DEX **id2** (USDC/USDT) and the six empty T3 vaults **35-40** built on it.

## Code Changes

### Action 1: Fully Restrict the dexV1 Test DEX at the Liquidity Layer

- **DEX**: `0x6d83f60eEac0e50A1250760151E81Db2a278e03a` (wstETH / ETH, early dexV1 test deployment, not deployed by the DexFactory)
- **Tokens**: wstETH (`0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0`), ETH (`0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`)

| Step | Call | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Borrow | `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPaused` for wstETH and ETH | Debt ceiling `10 / 20` (dust), expansion 0.01% over max duration |
| Supply | `setSupplyProtocolLimitsPaused` for wstETH and ETH | Base withdrawal limit `10` (dust), expansion 0.01% over max duration |
| Withdrawal limit | `updateUserWithdrawalLimit(dex, token, type(uint256).max)` for wstETH and ETH | Current withdrawal limit set to the full user supply, withdrawable `0` |

The last step matters: with only the supply restriction, the first operation after execution could still withdraw the full residual once (the withdrawal limit is only recomputed on the next operate). Setting the limit to the full supply closes that.

**Ordering:** the Team Multisig closes its position in this DEX before this proposal executes (swap/arbitrage pause, then withdraw and payback). If this action executes first, the Team Multisig can no longer withdraw.

### Action 2: Rebalance the wstETH/ETH T1 Vault (3)

- **Vault**: `0xA0F83Fc5885cEBc0420ce7C7b139Adc80c4F4D91` (T1, wstETH collateral / ETH debt)
- **Rebalancer**: Reserve Contract (`0x264786EF916af64a1DB19F513F24a3681734ce92`)

The vault's own total borrow is **≈0.00493 ETH** above its borrow at the Liquidity Layer. `rebalance()` borrows that difference to the Reserve, but the vault's Liquidity Layer ETH borrow limit is at dust (`11 / 22`), so the borrow fails and the rebalancer skips it.

| Step | Call |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Raise the vault's ETH debt ceiling at the Liquidity Layer to `1e18` raw (≈1 ETH; vault borrow ≈0.454 ETH) |
| 2 | `FLUID_RESERVE.updateRebalancer(TIMELOCK, true)`, `rebalanceVaults([vault 3], [0])`, `updateRebalancer(TIMELOCK, false)` |
| 3 | Restore the dust ETH debt ceiling via `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPaused` |

The supply-side difference (≈135 wei wstETH) is below Liquidity Layer storage precision (`UserModule__OperateAmountInsufficient`), so the vault's try/catch skips it. No Reserve allowance is needed.

### Action 3: Launch Limits for the weETH/ETH T1 Vault (182)

- **Vault**: `getVaultAddress(182)` = `0x0b8a681eD46EA8ec6b97d686dF0631Fbf84B03D2` (T1, weETH collateral / ETH debt)

| Parameter | Current (IGP-140) | New |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base withdrawal limit | ≈$7k | **$8M** |
| Base borrow limit | ≈$7k | **$15M** |
| Max borrow limit | ≈$9k | **$30M** |

- Set via `setVaultLimits` with the standard T1 expansion (50% over 6 hours).
- Risk parameters (CF 94% / LT 96% / LML 97% / LP 1%) were set by the Team Multisig. Team Multisig vault auth (granted in IGP-140) is kept for the pending OracleV2 switch.

### Action 4: Reduce Team Multisig wstETH & cbBTC Borrow Limits to Dust

- **User**: Team Multisig `0x4F6F977aCDD1177DCD81aB83074855EcB9C2D49e`
- **Tokens**: wstETH (`0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0`), cbBTC (`0xcbB7C0000aB88B473b1f5aFd9ef808440eed33Bf`)

| Parameter | Current (IGP-107 DEX Lite credit) | New |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base / max debt ceiling | $1M each (≈185 wstETH, ≈9.1 cbBTC borrowable) | **`10 / 20` wei** |
| Expansion | 1% over max duration | 0.01% over max duration |

- Calls `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPaused(TEAM_MULTISIG, token)` for wstETH and cbBTC, the same treatment USDC and USDT received in IGP-132 (action 2).
- Both credit lines are unused (0 debt). Mode 1 (with interest) matches the existing config, so no mode switch is triggered.

### Action 5: Exit iETHv2's Residual Test Positions

- **DSA**: iETHv2 strategy DSA `0x9600A48ed0f931d0c422D574e3275a90D8b22745` (#36121). Its auths are the iETHv2 vault and the Timelock, so the Timelock casts on it directly.
- **Connectors**: `FLUID-A` (old vault #3) and `FLUID-VAULT-T4-A` (vault 34).

| Position | Holding | Call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NFT 18, pre-launch vault #3 wstETH/ETH `0x28680f14C4Bb86B71119BC6e90E4e6D87E6D1f51` | 0.01 wstETH, no debt | `FLUID-A.operate`: withdraw all |
| NFT 2296, vault 34 wstETH/ETH T4 `0x57fed7c9b3c763999c519264931790cBcA331417` (on dex id1) | ≈0.0085 wstETH + 0.0104 ETH collateral, ≈0.0034 wstETH + 0.0042 ETH debt | `FLUID-VAULT-T4-A.operatePerfect`: repay `4e15` debt shares, withdraw 99.9% of the collateral |

- The Timelock sends **0.005 ETH** with the cast to cover the ETH leg of the vault 34 repayment; unused ETH is refunded. The wstETH leg is covered by the 0.01 wstETH freed from NFT 18.
- Vault 34 books slightly more debt shares than dex id1 records for it, so a max payback reverts. The action repays the dex-side shares explicitly; a dust debt and 0.1% of the collateral stay and are frozen by Actions 6 and 7.
- The cast is wrapped in `try/catch`, so a third-party partial repayment of NFT 2296 cannot block the rest of the proposal.
- About **$67** returns to iETHv2.

This action must run before Actions 6 and 7, which freeze both positions.

### Action 6: Fully Restrict IGP-45 Test DEXes id1 and id3 at the Liquidity Layer

- **dex id1**: `0x25F0A3B25cBC0Ca0417770f686209628323fF901` (wstETH / ETH, old DexFactory), tokens wstETH + ETH
- **dex id3**: `0x1d3e52a11B98Ed2AAB7eB0Bfe1cbB6525233204d` (WBTC / cbBTC, old DexFactory), tokens WBTC (`0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599`) + cbBTC (`0xcbB7C0000aB88B473b1f5aFd9ef808440eed33Bf`)

Same three steps as Action 1 for each DEX and token: `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPaused` (debt ceiling `10 / 20`), `setSupplyProtocolLimitsPaused` (base withdrawal limit `10`), `updateUserWithdrawalLimit(dex, token, type(uint256).max)` (withdrawable `0`).

| DEX | LL supply today | Base withdrawal limit today | Borrow side today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id1 | 0.0185 wstETH + 0.0227 ETH (≈$124) | 17.29 wstETH / 21.21 ETH (25% / 12h) | already non-borrowable (limit below borrow), 20% / 12h |
| id3 | 0.00202 WBTC + 0.00202 cbBTC (≈$343) | 0.807 WBTC / 0.808 cbBTC (25% / 12h) | already non-borrowable (limit below borrow), 20% / 12h |

- **Residual stays locked.** id1: the only user is vault 34, whose single position (NFT 2296) is reduced to dust in Action 5; the rest is the locked initial shares. id3: no user holds shares (vaults 41/42/43 whitelisted, all at 0); the residual is the locked initial shares only.

### Action 7: Restrict and Pause Pre-Launch Vaults and Old DEXes at the Liquidity Layer

**Pre-launch vaults** (old VaultFactory `0x3B38099b79a143038a3935C619B2A3eA70438C60`, created Feb 2024, closed for new activity in IGP-24):

| Vault | Supply token | Borrow token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x5eA9A2B42Bc9aC8CAC76E19F0Fcd5C1b06950807` (ETH/USDC) | ETH | USDC |
| `0xE53794f2ed0839F24170079A9F3c5368147F6c81` (ETH/USDT) | ETH | USDT |
| `0x28680f14C4Bb86B71119BC6e90E4e6D87E6D1f51` (wstETH/ETH) | wstETH | ETH |
| `0x460143a489729a3cA32DeA82fa48ea61175accbc` (wstETH/USDC) | wstETH | USDC |
| `0x2B251211f5Ff0A753A8d5B9411d736875174f375` (wstETH/USDT) | wstETH | USDT |

For each: `setSupplyProtocolLimitsPaused` (base withdrawal limit `10`), `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPaused` (debt ceiling `10 / 20`), `updateUserWithdrawalLimit(vault, supplyToken, type(uint256).max)`, then `LIQUIDITY.pauseUser(vault, [supplyToken], [borrowToken])`.

**Vaults 42 / 43** (T2, smart collateral on dex id3, debt at the Liquidity Layer): `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPaused` for USDC (42) / USDT (43), then `pauseUser` on the borrow side. Neither vault has open positions.

**dex id1 / dex id3** (limits already restricted in Action 6): `LIQUIDITY.pauseUser(dex, [token0, token1], [token0, token1])`. This also freezes the vaults built on them (34, 41, 42, 43).

DEX-level user configs of the old-factory DEXes are not governed by the Timelock, so this action only touches the Liquidity Layer.

### Action 8: Restrict and Pause IGP-45 Test DEX id2 and Vaults 35-40 at the Liquidity Layer

**dex id2** `0x085B07A30381F3Cc5A4250e10E4379d465b770ac` (USDC / USDT, old DexFactory): borrow of ≈113.9 USDC + 113.1 USDT (locked initial debt shares, borrowable 0) still on a 20% / 12h config; no supply configs. `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPaused` for USDC and USDT (debt ceiling `10 / 20`), then `pauseUser` on the borrow side.

**Vaults 35-40** (T3, collateral at the Liquidity Layer, smart debt on dex id2): 0 positions and 0 supply, but supply configs still open at 25% / 12h. For each: `setSupplyProtocolLimitsPaused` (base withdrawal limit `10`), then `pauseUser` on the supply side.

| Vault | Address | Supply token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 35 | `0xB58634A962A579bD01c392451a718cB5d74DfB53` | ETH |
| 36 | `0xA9FF23CfF9439c418DA08CE7954a92E46311761e` | wstETH |
| 37 | `0xB9Bb0b2354884B4B9dBDDaeb01feEcf507695e33` | weETH |
| 38 | `0x2d38ca861aC948BF90cC682fC1455138173c1923` | WBTC |
| 39 | `0x5896d226882CEdd99eA30d25DbC5025B5706144b` | cbBTC |
| 40 | `0x274D1171F06E976a4f545E6d4bf017bEDC51F752` | sUSDe |

All seven configs are already mode 1 (with interest), so no mode switch is triggered.

### Action 9: Restrict and Pause the Hidden USDe Vaults 66-73 at the Liquidity Layer

All hidden in the UI, dust positions only.

| Vault | Address | Supply token | Borrow token | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 66 | `0xB98EeA7132f1De6EC24D4Ee4AfBDf4d63Ef1a9F0` | USDe | USDC | borrow to dust (max was ≈$53.5M) + pause |
| 67 | `0x8FB5c0896C70B0056A09249EcEF7E7Ee01f037AF` | USDe | USDT | borrow to dust (max was ≈$53.3M) + pause |
| 68 | `0x75580D4be33C61700969583fDAeC566Ca84e5B69` | USDe | GHO | borrow to dust (max was ≈$21.6M) + pause |
| 69 | `0x2f6c2A725EA6c4304cdC92B49F637a7735362EF5` | ETH | USDe | pause (borrow already dust) |
| 70 | `0x903c5704Df7BF307E27e9E3dE76EA295Bc1A2970` | wstETH | USDe | pause (borrow already dust) |
| 71 | `0xC752107aE8447D85Cd5C06dA7089956Fe85dFDaB` | weETH | USDe | pause (borrow already dust) |
| 72 | `0xD170252cbeC41235795D938cA19857CA4d7824a1` | WBTC | USDe | pause (borrow already dust) |
| 73 | `0x75904e18b461eB60692264d40Adb0973D8f33b98` | cbBTC | USDe | pause (borrow already dust) |

Borrow to dust = `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPaused` (debt ceiling `10 / 20`). Pause = `LIQUIDITY.pauseUser(vault, [supplyToken], [borrowToken])`.

### Action 10: Close the dex 5 USDC-ETH Test Market and Vault 62

**dex 5** `0x2886a01a0645390872a9eb99dAe1283664b0c524` (USDC / ETH) was a Nov 2024 test market. Swaps and vault 62 were paused in Dec 2024 and it never launched, but its share caps (7.5M supply / 5M borrow shares) and the vault 62 borrow config at the DEX were never cut.

| Step | Call |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `setBorrowProtocolLimitsPausedDex(dex 5, vault 62)`, vault 62 (`0xAF861f04304216A0CeeA709D87556C826109E7F3`, T4) borrow at the DEX to dust |
| 2 | `pauseUser(vault 62, false, true)` on dex 5: re-pauses vault 62 borrow, because the DEX borrow config write sets the user back to unpaused. Its supply side is untouched and stays paused |
| 3 | `updateMaxSupplyShares(1)` and `updateMaxBorrowShares(1)` on dex 5 |

dex 5 is already paused at the Liquidity Layer. This action does not write its Liquidity Layer config, and those writes keep the pause bit anyway, so no Liquidity Layer pause call is needed.

### Action 11: Cap dex 27 (wstUSR-USDC) Supply Shares

**dex 27** `0xd64e12101614209eE810EFDe214542A2cb68d9fD` (hidden): `updateMaxSupplyShares(1)`. No new deposits; existing LPs can still withdraw.

### Action 12: Restrict and Pause the Dust-Launch Vaults 95 and 167

| Vault | Address | Type | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 95 | `0xbee8D906BAc00610D8056C88EeEc5E9e9D48104C` | T1 eBTC / cbBTC | supply + borrow to dust, withdrawal limit pinned to full supply, `pauseUser` supply + borrow (same as Action 7) |
| 167 | `0x46a719593378079F242faB86F0d7dEa50D84f28b` | T2 PST-USDC (dex 45) / USDC | USDC borrow at the Liquidity Layer to dust + `pauseUser` borrow; supply at dex 45 (`0x40D66b5f8f1521F97C2acA54dD200Fe3Ca035328`) to dust + `pauseUser(vault, true, false)` |

Dex 45 itself is left unchanged.

## Description

1. **dexV1 test DEX**: closes out the last live Liquidity Layer limits of an early test deployment after the Team Multisig exits its position.
2. **Vault 3 rebalance**: clears the borrow-side drift the rebalancer cannot reach while the vault sits at dust borrow limits, and returns it to dust in the same action.
3. **weETH/ETH vault**: moves vault 182 from dust to launch limits.
4. **Team Multisig credit**: closes the unused IGP-107 wstETH and cbBTC DEX Lite credit lines, matching the USDC/USDT cut in IGP-132.
5. **iETHv2 test positions**: iETHv2 withdraws its residual test positions from the pre-launch wstETH/ETH vault (NFT 18) and vault 34 (NFT 2296) before they are frozen. The Timelock sends 0.005 ETH to cover the ETH leg of the vault 34 repayment; about $67 returns to iETHv2.
6. **IGP-45 test DEXes id1/id3**: closes the Liquidity Layer limits of two early test DEXes holding only dust.
7. **Pre-launch vaults and old DEXes**: restricts and pauses at the Liquidity Layer the remaining protocols from the old vault and DEX factories.
8. **IGP-45 test DEX id2 and vaults 35-40**: restricts and pauses at the Liquidity Layer the remaining IGP-45 test DEX id2 (USDC/USDT) and the six empty T3 vaults (35-40) built on it.
9. **Hidden USDe vaults 66-73**: removes the remaining open borrow limits (≈$128M combined max) and pauses all eight at the Liquidity Layer.
10. **dex 5 test market**: closes the share caps and vault 62 borrow config left open on a never-launched test DEX.
11. **dex 27**: stops new deposits into the hidden wstUSR-USDC DEX.
12. **Dust-launch vaults 95 / 167**: restricts and pauses two mainnet vaults that only hold dust launch positions.

## Conclusion

IGP-141 closes the dexV1 test DEX at the Liquidity Layer, rebalances vault 3 without leaving any borrow capacity open, launches the weETH/ETH vault, closes the Team Multisig's remaining wstETH/cbBTC credit lines, returns iETHv2's residual test positions, closes the IGP-45 test DEXes id1/id2/id3 at the Liquidity Layer, restricts and pauses the remaining pre-launch vaults, old DEXes, and vaults 35-40, and closes the hidden USDe vaults 66-73, the dex 5 test market, dex 27 deposits, and the dust-launch vaults 95 / 167.
